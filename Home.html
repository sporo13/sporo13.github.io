		To your tenants, you are a government-installed Landlord in a totalitarian State. However, that is simply a facade that hides your real mission: to covertly watch your tenants. You must BUG their apartments while they're away, SEARCH their belongings for anything that can threaten the authority of the State, PROFILE them for your superiors and REPORT anyone capable of violating the laws.

		Remember: You are just a cog in a totalitarian machine â€“ a cog that has been given the power to destroy the privacy of any person. Will you pass this test of power?
